# Trading on Trends 
# Advanced Stock Sentiment Analysis System

An intelligent, end-to-end system that combines **social media sentiment**, **financial market data**, and **technical analysis** to predict stock price movements. Built using Python, Flask, and advanced machine learning models, this project enables real-time analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations.

## Key Features

### API Integrations

* **Reddit API (PRAW)**
  Collects sentiment data from financial subreddits
  Method: `fetch_reddit_data()`

* **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)**
  Fetches OHLCV data and historical stock prices
  Method: `fetch_stock_data()`

* **Flask API**
  Provides web endpoints for real-time analysis
  Route: `/analyze`

### Data Preprocessing and Transformation

* **Text Cleaning**
  Removes URLs, special characters, and normalizes whitespace
  Method: `clean_text()`

* **Data Merging**
  Aligns stock and sentiment data based on dates
  Method: `merge_stock_and_sentiment()`

* **Missing Value Handling**
  Uses forward/backward fill for stock data and zero-fill for sentiment

* **Feature Engineering**
  Includes technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
  Adds lag features, rolling means, and interaction terms
  Method: `add_technical_indicators()`

### Machine Learning Models

#### Classification (Stock Price Direction - Up/Down)

* Logistic Regression (L2 Regularization)

* Random Forest Classifier

* XGBoost Classifier
  Methods: `train_models()`, `_evaluate_logistic_model()`

* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC

* Includes confusion matrix visualization

#### Regression (Stock Return %)

* Ridge Regression

* Gradient Boosting Regressor

* XGBoost Regressor
  Methods: `train_models()`, `_evaluate_linear_model()`

* **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, R² Score, Directional Accuracy
